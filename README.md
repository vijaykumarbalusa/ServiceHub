## 📝 Project Overview

Service Hub is a modern web platform that bridges the gap between customers and local service providers (plumbing, electrical, painting, carpentry, and more).  
The platform enables users to book appointments, manage bookings, and make payments online, while providers and admins get rich dashboards and analytics.  
Built as a real-world, production-ready solution for community engagement and digital transformation.
